Matrix Primary Square Root Alghorithms Implementation

(With the support of scientific libraries Scipy and Numpy)
  
  - Schur Method
  - Newoton's Method (also scaled version)
  - DB (also scaled version and multi precision)
  - DB Product (also scaled version)
  - IN (scaled version does not work)

Next step is to compare those algorithms by precision and stability
